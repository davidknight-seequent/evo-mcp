"""Practical relevance check for the tool-search strategy.

Backs the PR review question "when used in practice does this approach feel good
for finding relevant tools?". Instead of answering by intuition, this registers
the *real* Evo tool catalog, hides it behind tool-search, and asserts that a
natural-language query surfaces the expected tool within the top-N results.

Run just this file with::

    PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest tests/test_tool_search_relevance.py -q
