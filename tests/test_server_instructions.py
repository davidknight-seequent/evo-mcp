"""Verify the server delivers its instructions over the MCP initialize handshake.

Backs the PR review question "do all clients implement the ability to read these
server instructions?". The MCP spec carries ``instructions`` in the ``initialize``
result, so any spec-compliant client *receives* them. Whether a client injects
them into the model prompt is client-dependent — which is exactly why the same
critical preconditions are also encoded in tool descriptions and in the
always-visible bootstrap pins (covered by ``test_tool_strategy.py``).
